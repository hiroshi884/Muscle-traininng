# what is mascle-training?
this is managing and sharing fitness.It can record training which  is done every days,and can share your reccrds with yourfriends.
# why did I make it?
During stay homing, I do muscle training.But,fitness is difficult to do every days.Because it is hard to stay motivated.My friends who  do muscle training also think same things.SO I share records with his.
Because when we see his record, we think they did harder than me.Then, I will do my best not to lose his. So I think that if we have place which can share my records with friends, we can watch each other to stay motivated.
